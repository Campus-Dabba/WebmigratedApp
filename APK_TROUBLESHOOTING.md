# 📱 APK Installation & Troubleshooting Guide

## 🚨 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "App not installed" or "Installation failed"

**Solution:**
1. **Enable Developer Options** on your Android phone:
   - Go to Settings → About Phone
   - Tap "Build Number" 7 times until you see "Developer options enabled"

2. **Enable Installation from Unknown Sources**:
   - Settings → Security → Unknown Sources (Enable)
   - OR Settings → Apps → Special Access → Install Unknown Apps → Chrome/File Manager (Enable)

3. **Check Android Version Compatibility**:
   - Your APK targets Android 14+ (API 34)
   - Make sure your phone runs Android 7.0+ (API 21) minimum

### Issue 2: "Parse Error" or "There was a problem parsing the package"

**Solution:**
1. **Re-download the APK** - file might be corrupted
2. **Use a different file manager** to install
3. **Clear cache** of your current installer app

### Issue 3: App installs but won't open/crashes immediately

**Solution:**
1. **Check internet connection** - app needs internet to load your website
2. **Clear app data**: Settings → Apps → CampusDabba → Storage → Clear Data
3. **Restart your phone**
4. **Try the debug version** instead of release

## 📋 Step-by-Step Installation Process

### Method 1: Direct Installation (Recommended)

1. **Transfer APK to your phone**:
   ```
   Option A: USB Cable
   - Connect phone to computer
   - Copy CampusDabba.apk to Downloads folder
   
   Option B: Cloud Storage
   - Upload APK to Google Drive/Dropbox
   - Download on phone
   
   Option C: ADB (Advanced)
   - adb install CampusDabba.apk
   ```

2. **Install the APK**:

   - Tap "Install" when prompted
   - Wait for installation to complete

# Install debug APK
adb install CampusDabba.apk

# Or install release APK
adb install CampusDabba-release.apk

# If already installed, use -r to reinstall
adb install -r CampusDabba.apk
```

## 🔧 Advanced Troubleshooting

### If app installs but shows blank/white screen:

1. **Check your website** is working:
   - Open https://campusdabba0.netlify.app in phone browser
   - Make sure it loads properly

2. **Clear WebView cache**:
   - Settings → Apps → Android System WebView → Storage → Clear Cache
   - Settings → Apps → Chrome → Storage → Clear Cache

3. **Update WebView**:
   - Play Store → Search "Android System WebView" → Update

### If app crashes on startup:

1. **Check crash logs**:
   ```bash
   adb logcat | grep CampusDabba
   ```

2. **Try debug version**:
   - Use CampusDabba.apk instead of CampusDabba-release.apk
   - Debug version has more logging

3. **Check permissions**:
   - Settings → Apps → CampusDabba → Permissions
   - Enable all required permissions

## 🛠️ Rebuilding APK with Fixes

If the current APK doesn't work, let's rebuild with better compatibility:

### Create a more compatible APK:

1. **Lower target SDK** for better compatibility:
   ```bash
   cd android
   # Edit app/build.gradle
   # Change targetSdk from 34 to 30
   ./gradlew clean
   ./gradlew assembleDebug
   ```

2. **Add network security config** for HTTP sites:
   ```xml
   <!-- Add to android/app/src/main/res/xml/network_security_config.xml -->
   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
   <network-security-config>
       <domain-config cleartextTrafficPermitted="true">
           <domain includeSubdomains="true">campusdabba0.netlify.app</domain>
       </domain-config>
   </network-security-config>
   ```

## 📱 Testing Your APK

### Before installation, verify:

1. **APK integrity**:
   ```bash
   # Check APK is valid
   aapt dump badging CampusDabba.apk
   ```

2. **File size** should be around 6-8MB (yours are correct)

3. **Internet connectivity** on your phone

### After installation:

1. **Check app info**:
   - Settings → Apps → CampusDabba
   - Should show version, package name, etc.

2. **Test basic functionality**:
   - App opens without crashing
   - Splash screen appears
   - Website loads
   - Can navigate and interact

## 🚨 Quick Fix Script

If nothing works, try this quick rebuild:

```bash
cd "/Users/arnavangarkar/Desktop/Devhack6.0_Campus_Dabba copy 2"

# Clean everything
cd android
./gradlew clean

# Rebuild with lower target SDK for compatibility
./gradlew assembleDebug

# Copy to main directory
cp app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk ../CampusDabba-fixed.apk

echo "Try installing CampusDabba-fixed.apk"
```

## 📞 Emergency Fallback

If APK still doesn't work:

1. **Use Chrome's "Add to Home Screen"**:
   - Open https://campusdabba0.netlify.app in Chrome
   - Menu → Add to Home Screen
   - Creates app-like shortcut

2. **PWA Installation** (if your site supports it):
   - Most modern websites can be installed as PWAs
   - Works almost like native app

## 🔍 What to Check Right Now

1. **Android version** of your phone?
2. **Have you enabled Unknown Sources**?
3. **Does https://campusdabba0.netlify.app work in your phone browser**?
4. **Any error messages** when trying to install?
