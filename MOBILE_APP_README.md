## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **App won't install**: Enable "Unknown Sources" in Android settings
2. **Website not loading**: Check internet connection and ensure https://campusdabba0.netlify.app is accessible
3. **Authentication issues**: Same as web - check Supabase configuration
4. **Performance issues**: The app loads your website, so performance depends on your site and internet connection

### Caveats:

1. **WebView Limitations**: Some web features may behave differently in WebView vs browser
2. **OAuth Redirects**: Social login redirects may need special handling in mobile context
3. **File Downloads**: Browser downloads work differently in app context
4. **URL Navigation**: External links will open within the app by default

## 🎯 Next Steps for Enhanced Mobile Experience

If you want to add more native features later:

1. **Push Notifications**: Use Capacitor's Push Notifications plugin
2. **Camera Integration**: Native camera access for profile pictures
3. **Offline Storage**: Cache data locally for offline access
4. **Geolocation**: Enhanced location features for delivery
5. **Share API**: Native sharing capabilities
