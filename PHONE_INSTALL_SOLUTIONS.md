# üîß Phone Shows APK as "BIN" - Solutions

## The Problem
Your phone's file manager is showing the `.apk` file as a "BIN" (binary) file instead of recognizing it as an Android app package. This is a MIME type recognition issue.

## ‚úÖ Available APK Files (Try in this order)

1. **`CampusDabba_Signed.apk`** (7.5 MB) - **RECOMMENDED**
   - Explicitly signed with Android debug keystore
   - Should have proper MIME type headers

2. **`CampusDabba_Mobile.apk`** (7.6 MB)
   - Uses underscores instead of hyphens
   - Some Android systems prefer this naming

3. **`CampusDabba.apk`** (7.6 MB)
   - Simple name without special characters
